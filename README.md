# XY-spin-glass-model-on-a-3D-cubic-lattice
In this project I simulated the 3D XY spin glass model using Monte Carlo methods (Metropolis, over-relaxation, and parallel tempering) to study its thermodynamic behavior and search for a spin glass transition. The code was implemented in C++ and analyzed in Python.
