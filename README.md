# XY spin glass model on a 3D cubic lattice
In this project, I studied the XY spin glass model on a 3D cubic lattice using advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The system consists of planar spins with continuous angular degrees of freedom, interacting via random Gaussian couplings, leading to frustration and disorder typical of spin glasses. The numerical implementation combined Metropolis updates, over-relaxation moves, and parallel tempering (replica exchange) to efficiently sample the rugged energy landscape and equilibrate at low temperatures. The main focus was on investigating the thermodynamic behavior and searching for signs of a spin glass transition in three dimensions, such as the behavior of the spin overlap distribution. The simulations were implemented from scratch in C++ and analyzed using Python, with attention to finite-size scaling and thermalization diagnostics.

# How the code works:
The file montecarlo.hpp contains the core of the simulation, which relies on the randnumgen.hpp library to generate pseudo-random numbers. The "main.cpp" file calls these components to execute the program. Finally, an example configuration file named "config.txt" is included, from which the program reads the system control parameters.
